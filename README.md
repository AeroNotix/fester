Fester is a metrics aggregator consisting of a Storm service which
reads from a Kafka queue and emits events through a topology which
looks like the below:

In Fester, the raw metrics are saved to Cassandra immediately. Kafka
ensures that all metrics are seen by fester and Storm allows for
processing each metric *at least once*.

The rollup bolts collect events for their period, write an aggregated
value to a rollup table and then emit an aggregated event. This means
we can chain any number of aggregation types and aggregation periods
together.
